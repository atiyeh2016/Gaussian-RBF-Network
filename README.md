# Gaussian-RBF-Network  

The aim is to assess the robustness of the Gaussian-RBF-Network against adversarial attacks.  
In order to increase training speed, the PCA method is used to decrease input dimensions from 724*724 to 28*28 in the MNIST dataset.  
Using the FGSM attack, the robustness of the network after adding additive isotropic Gaussian noise is evaluated.
